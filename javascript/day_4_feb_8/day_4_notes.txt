Function
========
1. pre-Defined (the function logic is alredy written, we just have to use them)
   console.log(), window.alert(), document.write()
2. User-Defined (we have to write the function and we have to use)
   a. Function Declaration
   b. Function Expression
   c. Self Invoked
   d. Arrow function (ES-6 2015)
   

Function Declaration vs Function Expression
============================================
1. Function declarations are named , function expressions are anonymous
2. Function declarations are hoisted , function expressions are not hoisted


Arrow Function
==============
Shorter Syntax
Implicit Return / no return keyword
No Function Keyword


How 'this' works in arrow function and regular function
========================================================
Regular Function : this - how/where the function is called
Arrow  : Arrow Function Doesn't have its own 'this'
         arrow function always uses 'this' from the sorounding/lexical scope
         where the function is written
'this' : is the context where a function is being executed


Use cases where arrow function shouldn't be used
================================================
-arrow functions shouldn't be used as object methods.
-arrow function shouldn't be used if 'this' should be dynamic.
