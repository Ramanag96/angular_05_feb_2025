Arrow Function Benefits
=======================
-To use 'this' from the lexical Scope.
-when a function is sused as callback, arrow function should be used


Use Strict
==========
-provides better coding standard and stronger error checking.
-'use strict' is only recognized at the beginning of a script or a function.
-JavaScript modules are automatically in strict mode, with no statement needed to initiate it.(import/export)
-The purpose of "use strict" is to execute the javascript in "strict mode".
-when 'use strict' is not written, browser runs the JS in normal mode.
-when 'use strict' is  written, browser runs the JS in strict mode.
-in Normal mode few mistakes are ignored, in strict mode mistakes are not ignored

1. variable declaration without var/let/const is not allowed.
   makes it impossible to accidentally create global variables.
2. function with duplicate arguements are not allowed.
3. NaN/undefined/Infinity cann't be used as a variable name.
4. Delete of an unqualified identifier in strict mode. 
    ex:delete Object.prototype; 
	var x = 5; delete x;
5. Multiple assignments not allowed.
   var a = b = c = 3;
6. 'this' is undefined, when a function is invoked from Global Context in strict mode.



String
======
-strings are used to represent and manipulate a sequence of characters.
-JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.
-We can use single or double quotes for string. 
	  var a='hello'; 
	  var b="hello";
-We can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string.
	var answer1 = 'It's alright'; //in-valid
	var answer1 = "It's alright"; //valid
	var answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";  //valid
	var answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"'; // valid
-Strings can be created in 2 ways
	1. as primitives, using string literals; 
	   var a = 'hello';
	2. as objects, using the String() constructor
	   var b = new String('hello');
-JavaScript automatically converts primitives to String objects, so that it's possible 
 to use String object methods for primitive strings.
-String primitives and String objects give different results when using eval(). 
 Primitives passed to eval are treated as source code; String objects are treated as all other objects are, by returning the object..
	let s1 = '2 + 2'              // creates a string primitive
	let s2 = new String('2 + 2')  // creates a String object
	console.log(eval(s1))         // returns the number 4
	console.log(eval(s2))         // returns the string "2 + 2"
-A String object can always be converted to its primitive counterpart with the valueOf() method.
	console.log(eval(s2.valueOf()))  // returns the number 4
	

1. literal
   var str1 = "sachin";
   typeof str1; //string

2. object
   var str2 = new String("sachin");    
   typeof str2;   //"object"

var a = "sachin";
var b = "sachin"
a == b; // true

var a = "sachin";
var b = new String("sachin")
a == b; // true

var a = new String("sachin");
var b = new String("sachin");
a == b;  // false



String methods:
--------------
length;
toUpperCase();
toLowerCase();
charAt();
at()
charCodeAt();
concat();
indexOf();
lastIndexOf();
includes();
match();
matchAll()   // returns iterator
replace();
replaceAll();
repeat();
slice(start, end)
substring(start, end)
substr(start, length)
split()
search(regex)
trim()
eval(); (eval() is from Window Object)
localeCompare()

N.p:- substring() cannot accept negative indexes. slice() does.
